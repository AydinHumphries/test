**to recreate:** 

simply type the same code as I used in the screenshots above or access these patches from github to test yourself:

https://github.com/AydinHumphries/test/


keep in mind, I don't know what it is that causes the code to work sometimes and other times not to. so you may be able to find it works now but doesn't work in say, a month. or the reverse. I'm not sure how else to prove this issue exists than to post the above screenshots.

**OS:**

windows 10, lenovo laptop

**urgency:**

medium - if a patch fails because of this consistency check failed editor thing, you could have to rework the whole thing. or if no solution on vanilla exists try to recreate the patch and just hope you don't run into this issue again.

**context:**
an individual issue from the longer thread about inconsistencies found with dynamic patching and the importance of addressing them: #1147 "
